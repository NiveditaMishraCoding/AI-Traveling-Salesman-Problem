## Project name 
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Stochastic Local Search

## Introduction
The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is an algorithmic problem tasked with finding the shortest route 
between a set of points and locations that must be visited.
In the Stochastic Local Search method, we use Simulated annealing.
Simulated annealing uses a noise model inspired by statistical mechanics.

## Requirements
This module requires the following:
[IntelliJ]https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/
or any other Java IDE

## Installation
Install as you would normally install an IntelliJ IDE. For further
information, see
[Installing IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

## Usage
Open the downloaded project in the IntelliJ IDE.
In the SlS folder, there is a file called as Constants.
In that file, change the value for the variable folderPath to wherever input files are. Make sure its the absolute path.
Example: public String folderPath="Dir1/Dir2/Dir3/"

Run file SimulatedAnnealingSls.java
